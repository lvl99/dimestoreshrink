## What is this?
 
Dimestore Shrink is a silly idea that was initially just an experiment in randomly generating names of psychological
conditions and human-readable descriptions to accompany them.

After I did that, some point later I read an article on [Motherboard](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mg7g3y/how-to-make-a-not-racist-bot)
about bots and thought it'd be interesting to experiment by porting Dimestore Shrink's generative parts into an
(somewhat) interactive twitterbot, called Dr. Hugh Schtinck.

I made this at some point in early/mid 2016, so the JS code is still in ES5.


## Interacting with the Twitterbot

You can do stuff like this:
 - Tweet a question like "@dimestoreshrink what's wrong with me?" to get an assessment.
 - If you tweet anything else to @dimestoreshrink he'll reply back with a witty or stupid comment.


## Disclaimer

I think awareness of one's mental health is a very important subject, and this is a very goofy tongue-in-cheek way to
approach the sensitive issues of mental health.

While I'm taking a humorous non-targeted approach to psychological assessment (it is based on random generation), I'm
sensitive to those who may be afflicted with real psychological issues. If you feel this project is overstepping any
boundaries, feel free to let me know why.
